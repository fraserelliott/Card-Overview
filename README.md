Card Overview (v1.1.3) by Fraser Elliott aka FraserNotFrasier

# What is this?

Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories is a game that people like to try to complete as quickly as possible. This program was created to help runners of Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories to show the progress of their deck during a run or race. Tools available at the time did not have all of the features I wanted, so I made this.

To use, right click a blank box (next to the textbox with a 0 in it) and click on 'Select Image'. Search for a card either by id, name, card type (monster, magic, trap, equip, ritual) or type (spellcaster, dragon, warrior, etc). Pick your selected card and press 'Set'.
The buttons on the main panel (with the toolbox) correspond to the boxes in the same location on the left.

In OBS, use 'Window Capture' and choose 'Card Overview - Display'. I suggest also picking a chromokey, the default is green (#00FF00) but you can change it in the 'Settings' menu. There is an issue where closing Card Overview might cause you to need to re-select 'Card Overview - Display' in window capture. Sadly, there is no fix except for using OBS Studio.
